# CORE-01-INDEX

## Scope
repository identity and source-of-truth map

## Current source of truth
- `path:README.md`

- `path:CHANGELOG.md`

## Facts
- Core memories index repository identity, source-of-truth files, and the current validation map.

## Evidence
- `commit:9330d026c96dcf7fd24ea9d6e70aebf063415511`
- `path:README.md`
- `path:VERSION`
- `path:CHANGELOG.md`

## Known pitfalls
- Treat this memory as derived context. Current code, configuration, runtime output, and GitHub state override stale memory text.

## Update policy
Update after verified changes to the referenced source-of-truth files.

## Delete / merge policy
- Delete or merge only when the referenced source-of-truth files no longer support this memory and the replacement memory preserves the durable facts.
