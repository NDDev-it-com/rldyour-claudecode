# RELEASE-01-VALIDATION

## Purpose

Versioning, changelog, validation, tagging, and release evidence contracts for this marketplace.

## Source Of Truth

- `VERSION`: marketplace/release boundary version.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Keep-a-Changelog release notes.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: marketplace plugin versions.
- `plugins/<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: per-plugin behavior/cache-refresh versions.
- `README.md`: active catalog version summary and smoke/check commands.
- `docs/release-process.md`: release process reference.
- `scripts/validate_marketplace.sh`: full validation harness.
- `scripts/validate_plugin_versions.py`: marketplace/manifest version consistency.
- `scripts/smoke_serena_memory_taxonomy.sh`: focused Serena memory taxonomy regression smoke.

## Current Behavior

- Current release boundary at HEAD: `VERSION` is `0.1.5`.
- `rldyour-serena-mcp` is `0.1.5` in both its `plugin.json` and marketplace entry.
- `rldyour-mcps` remains `0.1.3`; other plugins remain `0.1.2`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains `[0.1.5] - 2026-05-15` documenting the numbered Serena memory taxonomy, analyzer schema v2, Stop-hook guidance, recursive memory scan, runtime-marker filtering, fullrepo-managed stale refusal, instruction-only sync relevance, CLAUDECODE target mapping, and memory migration.
- `scripts/validate_marketplace.sh` is the broad local gate and includes `claude plugin validate`, JSON parse, Python AST, shell syntax, frontmatter checks, version consistency, instruction docs, routing policy, MCP runtime drift checks, and `scripts/smoke_serena_memory_taxonomy.sh`.

## Contracts And Data

- Plugin cache refresh depends on per-plugin `plugin.json` version strings. Content-only plugin changes under the same version can be missed by the runtime cache.
- If a plugin's runtime behavior changes, bump that plugin version and align the marketplace entry.
- If a change affects the overall release boundary, update `VERSION` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Tag convention is `<plugin-name>--v<version>` through `claude plugin tag --push`.
- Tags should be created only after the worktree is clean for tracked files and validation passes.

## Change Rules

- For manifest or version changes, run `python3 scripts/validate_plugin_versions.py` and `bash scripts/validate_marketplace.sh`.
- For MCP runtime changes, also run `python3 scripts/check_mcp_runtime_versions.py` and relevant MCP smoke checks.
- For hook or memory-sync behavior changes, run shell syntax checks, analyzer/state script checks, `bash scripts/smoke_hooks.sh`, and `bash scripts/smoke_serena_memory_taxonomy.sh`.
- Avoid `scripts/smoke_fullrepo_sync.sh` after editing agent-only files unless prepared to restore/reapply them; it runs `--bootstrap-init` and can restore agent-only files from `origin/fullrepo`.

## Verification

- `python3 scripts/validate_plugin_versions.py`: version consistency.
- `bash scripts/validate_marketplace.sh`: full marketplace validation including Serena taxonomy smoke.
- `git diff --check`: whitespace sanity.
- `python3 plugins/rldyour-serena-mcp/scripts/analyze_sync_scope.py --from-ref HEAD --to-ref HEAD`: no-op analyzer sanity.
- `bash scripts/smoke_serena_memory_taxonomy.sh`: targeted memory taxonomy gate.
- `bash scripts/smoke_hooks.sh`: hook smoke.
- `bash scripts/smoke_mcp_runtime.sh`: MCP runtime smoke.
- `bash scripts/smoke_mcp_capabilities.sh`: MCP capability smoke; `figma` can be skipped when auth/session env is absent.
