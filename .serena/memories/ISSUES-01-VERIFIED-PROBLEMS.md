## Facts
- Issues memories record how GitHub issues and PRs become verified evidence after code/config checks.
- Status policy: issues and PRs are evidence only after verification against current code/config.

## Evidence
- `commit:a519d10eb604bfb6c7988aa1fda43b3aeecc46e5`
- `path:README.md`
- `path:plugins/rldyour-flow/skills/ry-review`

## Known pitfalls
- Treat this memory as derived context. Current code, configuration, runtime output, and GitHub state override stale memory text.

## Update policy
Update after verified changes to the referenced source-of-truth files.

## Delete / merge policy
- Delete or merge only when the referenced source-of-truth files no longer support this memory and the replacement memory preserves the durable facts.
