# Validation Gates

## Scope
validation gates and test suites

## Current source of truth
- `path:scripts`
- `path:.github/workflows`
- `path:README.md`


## Source Of Truth
- `path:scripts`
- `path:.github/workflows`
- `path:README.md`

## Facts
- Test memories record which suites and smoke tests prove the touched behavior.

## Evidence
- `commit:be48d065a841ae95f762177a7b70002ad93470fc`
- `path:scripts`
- `path:.github/workflows`
- `path:README.md`

## Known pitfalls
- Treat this memory as derived context. Current code, configuration, runtime output, and GitHub state override stale memory text.

## Update policy
Update after verified changes to the referenced source-of-truth files.

## Delete / merge policy
- Delete or merge only when the referenced source-of-truth files no longer support this memory and the replacement memory preserves the durable facts.

## Cross-References

- `RELEASE-01-VALIDATION.md`
