## Facts
- Docs memories record which instruction and operator docs must change after durable behavior changes.

## Evidence
- `commit:be48d065a841ae95f762177a7b70002ad93470fc`
- `path:AGENTS.md`
- `path:.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `path:README.md`

## Known pitfalls
- Treat this memory as derived context. Current code, configuration, runtime output, and GitHub state override stale memory text.

## Update policy
Update after verified changes to the referenced source-of-truth files.

## Delete / merge policy
- Delete or merge only when the referenced source-of-truth files no longer support this memory and the replacement memory preserves the durable facts.
