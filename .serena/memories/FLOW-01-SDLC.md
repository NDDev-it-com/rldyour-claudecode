## Facts
- Flow memories record ry-init, ry-start, ry-newp, ry-review, ry-repair, ry-deploy, and ry-sync behavior.

- `commit:cf5b25eb348ff012a2bcbbd2e4e61308207d674e`

## Known pitfalls
- Treat this memory as derived context. Current code, configuration, runtime output, and GitHub state override stale memory text.

## Update policy
Update after verified changes to the referenced source-of-truth files.

## Delete / merge policy
- Delete or merge only when the referenced source-of-truth files no longer support this memory and the replacement memory preserves the durable facts.
